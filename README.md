# Machine-Learning-Assignment
Final Project 

This assignment concerns tracking human movement via wearable devices.  6 devices were attached to the body and dumbbell of men who were asked to perform barbell lifts, both correctly and incorrectly.  Each man was identified.  (The devices included an acceleromter, a gyroscope and a magnetometer.)  The objective was learn the characteristics of movement in the training set, and apply it to a subsequent testing set.
